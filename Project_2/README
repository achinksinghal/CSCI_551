++The objective of this project is to emulate a M/M/2 queue using multi-threading within a single process. 


++Code Files:

mm2.cc: This file contains the code for the main function of emulation.

queue.cc: This file contains the code for queue functionality.

time_551.cc: This file contains the code for time related functions.

queue.h: This file is the header file for functions defined in queue.cc.

time_551.h: This file is the header file for functions defined in time_551.cc.

Makefile: This file is makefile for compiling code and creating mm2 binary.


++Design Desicion:

1. After CTRL + c is pressed, any next client will be dropped and Q1 will be emptied.

2. Client that are dropped as because CTRL + c is pressed are not considerd in customer drop probability.

3. Average inter-arrival time and service time are printed in milliseconds.

++Code reference:
	Code is reffered from the project specification.
